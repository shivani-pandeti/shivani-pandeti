## Hi there 👋 Shivani Pandeti here!
📊 Aspiring Data Analyst and - passionate about turning messy data into clear, actionable insights.
🎓 Master’s student in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University

I enjoy working at the intersection of data, business, and technology — whether that’s building predictive models, analyzing trends, or creating dashboards that actually get used.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

As a Master’s student in **Applied Data Science** at Syracuse University, with a background in **Information Technology** from Mumbai University, I’ve developed a strong foundation in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, **data visualization**, and **cloud technologies**. My focus is on applying these skills to **real-world problems**.

Professionally, I’ve worked with **real-world data** using **Python** and **SQL**. My work has involved **data cleaning**, **data validation**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, along with creating **clear, meaningful visualizations**. Alongside analytics, I’ve applied **machine learning techniques** to support **predictive** and **decision-focused use cases**, prioritizing solutions that are **practical** and **interpretable**.

Through this experience, I’ve learned how to approach problems **end-to-end** - from **understanding imperfect data** and **asking the right questions** to **communicating insights clearly** to both **technical** and **non-technical audiences**. 

Looking ahead, I’m preparing for **Data Analyst** and **Data Scientist roles**, where I can combine **analytical thinking**, **applied machine learning**, and **clear communication** to drive **data-driven decisions** and **meaningful impact**.
